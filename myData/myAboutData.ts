    "I'm JC Lee, 28. I'm an awkward introverted nerd who likes people and spend 8-12h a day, 7 days a week learning and building projects.",
    "When I need a break, I enjoy watching korean shows and reading mangas.",
    "I design projects with the Figma design tool.",
    "I'm also a full stack developer - meaning I can make static websites and websites with a database and backend server.",
    "My skills are, but not limited to:",

  skills: [
    "HTML, CSS, Javascript.",
    "MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS → MERN Stack.",
    "NextJS, Sanity → Jamstack.",
    "TailwindCSS, Typescript.",
    "RESTful services.",
    "Integration with email marketing tools like Mailchimp and SendGrid.",
    "Embedding posts from Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Youtube, etc.",
    "E-commerce with Stripe API.",
  ],
  outro: [
    "I've switched from MERN to Jamstack because NextJS and Sanity are the best tool available in 2021. They are using cloud technologies, the development process is much faster, maintenance low, and scaling easier and cheaper.",
    "NextJS makes blazing fast websites and Sanity is a content storage with a content management system so an editor can make change to the content, for example upload a new blog post, without the help of a developer.",
    "If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email or through my social accounts.",
